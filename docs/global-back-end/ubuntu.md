# Target Hardware

Running your own global back end provides the ultimate self-sufficiency, truly eliminating any dependence on third party service providers. Your software infrastructure communicates with a full node under you control, and thereby communicates with the blockchain network directly.

The Cash Stack targets ubiquitous x86 hardware with the following specifications:
- 32 GB of RAM
- 1 TB solid-state hard drive
- amd64 processor
- Ubuntu operating system

Desktop PCs can typically be purchased for around $400 which meets the above specifications. Dell and HP both make excellent desktops. A single desktop operated by a single technician can support 1,000 - 10,000 users. This allows small communities to operate self-sufficiently.

## Ubuntu

Ubuntu is chosen due to its ubiquitous distribution. Every cloud provider offers it as an operating system choice. It is the most commonly installed linux distribution. You can use any distribution you want, but Cash Stack videos and code deployments are based on Ubuntu.
