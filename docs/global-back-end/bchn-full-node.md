# Full Node

The bottom most layer in the Cash Stack is the Full Node. Every blockchain produces a full node, but not all full nodes can be operated on an normal desktop computer. The Cash Stack places a big emphasis on self-sufficiency and censorship resistance. The [PSF](https://psfoundation.info) maintains Docker containers for running full nodes on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH), eCash (XEC), and Avalanche (AVAX) blockchains.

## BCHN Full Node

There are many full node implementations for BCH. The Cash Stack focuses on the BCHN node because it is the software most commonly operated by miners.
