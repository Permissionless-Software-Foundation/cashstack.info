# Local Back End

The concept of a 'local' back end does not apply to the web 2 paradigm. It's a new concept that only applies in the scope of the web 3 Cash Stack.

As illustrated in the [introduction](intro), web 2 architecture has a centralized back end which the front end interacts with directly. In our web3 architecture, apps connect to a light-weight 'local' back end, which then proxies the communication over [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) to a 'global' back end.

**The main advantages of the web 3 architecture is <u>reducing cost</u> and <u>improving censorship resistance</u>.**

## ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer

The core piece of software making up the local back end is [ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer). This app provides a [REST API](https://free-bch.fullstack.cash/#api-REST_BCH) interface for front end apps to query data about the blockchain (and broadcast transactions).

`ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer` is configured to connect to one-of-many global back end services. This connection can change on-the-fly during operation in order to optimize performance. `ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer` connects to its mirror-image on the global back end: [ips-bch-wallet-service](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-bch-wallet-service). This connection happens by passing end-to-end encrypted (e2ee) messages over the [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) network, via a [Circuit Relay](/docs/local-back-end/circuit-relay).

## bch-consumer

Front end apps can connect directly to `ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer` via its [REST API](https://free-bch.fullstack.cash/#api-REST_BCH). This is the best option for non-JavaScript applications. But JavaScript applications can leverage the [bch-consumer library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bch-consumer), which is embedded in the [minimal-slp-wallet library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimal-slp-wallet).

Most JavaScript developers will not use the `bch-consumer` library directly, but will instead use the high-level functions in `minimal-slp-wallet`, which will call the local back end through its embedded instance of `bch-consumer`.

`bch-consumer` is a JavaScript library which provides an easy interface for interacting with `ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer`. It was inspired by the older [bch-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@psf/bch-js) JavaScript library, which has similar functionality for the older web 2 architecture.

## psf-bch-wallet

[psf-bch-wallet](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/psf-bch-wallet) is a command-line interface (**CLI**) application. It is the 'power tool' for Cash Stack developers. `psf-bch-wallet` is...

- A wallet for managing cryptocurrency and tokens.
- A rapid prototyping tool for trying out new ideas.
- An app for controlling and configuring `ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer`.
- A diagnostic tool for debugging network issues.
- A message app for sending and receiving end-to-end encrypted (e2ee) messages.
- An interface to the pay-to-write database ([P2WDB](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-p2wdb-service)).
- A tool for creating and managing collections of tokens and NFTs.


### Wallets and Rapid Prototyping

The obvious use of `psf-bch-wallet` is to manage wallets containing BCH and SLP tokens. The CLI app contains all the features available in [wallet.fullstack.cash](https://bchn-wallet.fullstack.cash), plus many additional features. Because there is no cumbersome graphical user interface (**GUI**) to deal with, it's much faster for JavaScript developers to hack on the CLI wallet and rapidly prototype new ideas.

### Controlling ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer

`psf-bch-wallet` is the primary way for issuing commands and controlling the network behavior of `ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer`. The `wallet-service` command will list all the global back ends that `ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer` can see on the network. The same command with a `-s` flag can instruct `ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer` to connect to a different global back end. Once connected, the `wallet-service-test` command will run diagnostic tests to ensure the global back end is fully functional and responsive.

- View global back end wallet services:
  - `./bin/run wallet-service`

- Change global back end wallet service:
  - `./bin/run wallet-service -s 12D3KooWEzE3HNH86WCb2Xocu6PgBCnSGUD7myJmuTHvoedMwp7K`

- Test the global back end to see if it is working correctly:
  - `./bin/run wallet-service-test`

By default, `psf-bch-wallet` connects to [free-bch.fullstack.cash](https://free-bch.fullstack.cash), which is a publically available instance of `ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer`, but its uptime is not guaranteed. The `conf` command is used to switch to a local instance of `ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer`. Here is an example for switching to a local instance of `ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer` running on port 5005:

- `./bin/run conf -k restServer -v http://localhost:5005`

### Network Diagnostics

The different `ipfs-*` commands are used for running diagnostics on the IPFS network. These commands are used to interrogate the IPFS node connected to `ipfs-bch-wallet-consumer`. You can list all the connected IPFS peers, and get information on connected [Circuit Relays](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/circuit-relay/). Circuit Relays are a critical element in networking and censorship resistance.

### Encrypted Messaging

`psf-bch-wallet` can send encrypted messages to any other `bitcoincash:` address. It can also decrypt and display any encrypted messages sent to your wallet. These messages are end-to-end encrypted (e2ee) using the same eliptic-curve encryption used to make Bitcoin payments.

### Pay-to-Write Database

The pay-to-write database ([P2WDB](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-p2wdb-service)) is a censorship-resistant database. It's similar in many ways to a blockchain, but better optimized for storing data. `psf-bch-wallet` can read and write data to the P2WDB. Raw data can be reviewed at [explorer.fullstack.cash](https://explorer.fullstack.cash).

### Tokens

`psf-bch-wallet` contains a series of commands for creating fungible and non-fungible (**NFT**) tokens. Explore the help for the `token-*` prefixed commands to learn more. Not only can you create and mint tokens, you can also set mutable (changeable) and immutable (unchangeable) data for the tokens (as per [PS002](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/specifications/blob/master/ps002-slp-mutable-data.md) and [PS007](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/specifications/blob/master/ps007-token-data-schema.md) specifications). This lets you set the token icon for your token, which will be displayed by [front end wallets](/docs/front-end).
