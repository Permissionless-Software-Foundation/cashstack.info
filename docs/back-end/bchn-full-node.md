# BCHN Full Node

The bottom most layer in the Cash Stack is the Full Node. Every blockchain produces a full node, but not all full nodes can be operated on an normal desktop computer. BCH full nodes can be easily run on a desktop, or even a small mini-computer like a Raspberry Pi. The [PSF](https://psfoundation.info) maintains a Docker container for running a full node on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain.

## BCHN Full Node

There are many full node implementations for BCH. The Cash Stack focuses on the BCHN node because it is the software most commonly operated by miners.
